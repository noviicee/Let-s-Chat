## ChatApp [Hack-The-Cables]

The 60s  was the time when people did not have mobile phones. Letter-writing was prominent. Then gradually as years passed, the telephone was invented in 1876. At that time, every house did not had a telephone. In case if anybody wanted to talk to a member of a family living elsewhere, they had to stand in a long queue, for their turn to come so they can finally talk.

But now, is the 21st century! It's time to ditch those long cables of telephone and gave a conversation with your friend, anytime you like ;)
